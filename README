HTML5 canvas / JavaScript application to connect points with others.
For example, you can combine words or sentences with their equivalent in another language.
You have the ability to undo and redo connections paths as well as remove a specific one.
It is also possible to create, edit and delete content using the application.
There is a protection against SQL injection and XSS.
When you correct your work, the application is returning your wrong paths if any (e.g. 4,5,2,1 -> point left 4 doesn’t match right 5, left 2 doesn’t match right 1).

Requirements: web server with PHP and MySQL, HTML5 web browser.
Database username/password can be replaced in script/base.php.
Default database name is "elan" and an example (French/German words) can be loaded in script/relier_points.sql.
The example can also be found in demo/index.htm which does not need a web server.

As a school project, you will find some French text and a lot of comments.
